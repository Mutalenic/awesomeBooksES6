# "Awesome books: with ES6"

> In this project, I built a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. I achieved that by using JavaScript objects and arrays, I also dynamically modified the DOM and added basic events.This is a basic SPA (Single Page Application) which is created by JavaScript classes and manipulated by DOM elements and JavaScript events. Simple USER INTERFACE that allows user to ADD and REMOVE books.
